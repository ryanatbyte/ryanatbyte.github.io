		<p>This page serves primarily as a quick summary, and a link tree home about me and my public cyberspace coding life.</p>
		<p>I started my career life at <a href="https://bytestudios.com">Bytestudios</a> in 2018 where I learned many things and grew greatly and will always be grateful for my time at such an interesting place with diverse and exciting projects!</p>
		<p>Presently, I am investigating and searching ways to combine my extensive web-related experience with 
		knowledge and experiences I gained in acquired my Applied Math, Engineering, and Physics degree from UW Madison 
		and other disciplines to more fully utilize my abilities to further what I believe to be worthy causes and endeavors.</p>

			<h2>Why I Bother to do Anything</h2>
			<div class="description">
				<p>One must live their life for themselves, because no one else can do it for them.  
			Indeed, unless you are unconscious or dead, it appears you must live it, so why not be pleased with how you do it?  
			To this end, when I become involved with something my objectives are multifaceted: 
					<ul>
						<li><strong>To enjoy the process.</strong>  Hardly anytime is truly spent idling at a destination, rather than the journey or the one that comes afterwards.  
							While where you're trying to go matters immensely, it is best to take a path there that you enjoy for its own sake and is best on its own merits 
							<br/>
							<blockquote>"The question, [...] is not whether you will love, hurt, dream, and die. It is what you will love, why you will hurt, when you will dream, and how you will die. This is your choice." --Stormlight Archive by Brandon Sanderson</blockquote>
						</li>
						<li><strong>To work towards something positive.</strong>  The impetus for starting a quest may not always be the reason you keep walking it, and you are not locked in once you start.  
						While I enjoy the process, I want to also believe that the process is transporting myself and us as a people to somewhere or something better, where the new problems are better problems than the old problems.  
						I am unwilling to engage with or further goals that I understand actively and corruptly seek to make the world worse for most people.  
						<br/>
						<blockquote>"I will take responsibility for what I have done.  If I must fall, I will rise each time a better man." --Stormlight Archive by Brandon Sanderson</blockquote>
						</li>
										
						<li><strong>To expand my understanding.</strong>  In order to know what proceses or missions, one must know things. 
						One learns things by engaging in expeditions and taking lessons from them.  
						It is a self-reinforcing cycle, appropriately applied, continually can make you not only more efficacious at fullfilling your goals, but discovering what those objectives should themselves be.  
						<br/>
						<blockquote>"The most important step a man can take. It's not the first one, is it? It's the next one. Always the next step" --Stormlight Archive by Brandon Sanderson</blockquote>
						
						</li>
						<li><strong>To not starve or otherwise be moved directly to great unpleasantness (especially without passing go and collecting $200!).</strong>  This one bears little need for elaboration.  Suffering without purpose, tautologically serves no purpose.  
						</li>
							
					</ul>

				<h3>Work Projects</h3>
				<p>At Byte, I had the opportunity to achieve these objects on a variety of projects.  These are some of the most noteworthy:  
				
					<ul>
						<li><strong><a href="https://collata.site">Collata CMS</a></strong> involvement in much of the  redesign to modularly upgrade the usability, portability, security, effectiveness, and usefulness for everyone of our proprietary CMS.  
						Additionally, I got to aid with the design and implementation of a system by which we can convert portions of our proprietary codebase to a planned open-source version release of CollataCMS</li>
						<li><strong><a href="https://collata.site/signup">Collata Signup System</a></strong> greatly contribute to a mostly-automated beta method people can use to sign up, test, and experience a new Byte site on their own</li>
		
						<li><strong>File/Asset Manager</strong> completely rework the stack for admins storing, uploading, and managing web assets to resolve multiple issues both we and clients identified</li>
						<li><strong><a href="https://cedarburglibrary.org/spaces/">Spaces System </a></strong> create the full stack of our very own portable, proprietary beta spaces management system to fullfill varying needs of multiple clients</li>
						
						
						<li><strong><a href="https://www.mpl.org/listening-to-mitchell/">Listening to Mitchell </a>A fully interactive experience using ThreeJS recreating a fascimile of the original public art project done in 2014 by artists Sonja Thomsen and Adam Carr including audio, pictures, video, animations, 
							a 3D model recreation of the relevant portions of Mitchell St. featuring a reactive and stimulating rendition of the exhibition and other site visitors' journeys, and an additional story sharing for visitors of the site to view each other and add new ones</strong></li>
						
						<li><strong><a href="https://celr.mcw.edu">MCW Community Engagement Learning Repository  </a></strong> one of my first projects with Byte, I got to craft most aspects of a system designed to upload, manage, view, and publically share connected topical documents by  Medical professional users and admins for the Medical College of Wisconsin. This included condensed information designs, intuitive forms, normalized backend data storage and statistics tracking, and a flexible and powerful search.</li>
						
						<li><strong><a href="https://cateringworks.com">CateringWorks </a></strong> where I got to learn, experiment, and implement with different interactive and reactive interface elements and visual designs </li>
						
						<li><strong>Email Processing System Updates for <a href="https://outpost.coop">Collata Signup System</a></strong> closely worked with Outpost IT staff to provide surgical updates to depreciating Outlook email APIs, admin interfaces, and form security and auditing</li>
